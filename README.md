# SPECache

This repository contains a demo of a side channel attack that can be used to extract sensitive information from a target system. The attack is based on analyzing power consumption variations in the target system to infer information about its internal state.

# Background

Side channel attacks are a type of attack that exploit information leakage in a system's implementation rather than its design. These attacks can be used to extract sensitive information such as encryption keys, passwords, and other confidential data.

The attack presented in this demo is a power analysis attack, which involves analyzing the power consumption of a target device to infer information about its internal state. By analyzing the power consumption of the device during certain operations, an attacker can potentially determine information such as encryption keys, passwords, and other confidential data.

# Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of side channel attacks such as this one, it is important to carefully design and implement systems to minimize information leakage. This may include techniques such as power supply noise reduction, differential power analysis countermeasures, and other hardware and software protections.
